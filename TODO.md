- [ ] what to do about missing data / data columns are not discontinuous / everyone has requisite data. All of the things where if you don’t have 2 rows or columns is doesn’t work. The first column of the text_data doesn't do anything, so indicate that. well it does set the file name right?
- [ ] throw a warning for {some_misspelled_name} if its not found in var_names
- [ ] use dictionaries / collections, so they aren't dependent on order
- [ ] Generalize super/subscript
- [ ] what if you try to insert on a page that isn't there?
