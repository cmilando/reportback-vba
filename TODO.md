### FOR MVP

####Validation:

- [ ] make it so it doesn’t error if you don't select a file
- [ ] make checks for that all the columns in data sheet are found in  the template
- [ ] and that there are no misspellings
- [ ] and that data columns are not discontinuous
- [ ] and that everyone has requisite data 
- [ ] what to do about missing data
- [ ] check that it says either ppt or pdf, or change to radio 

### Notes for manual validation checks
- [ ] according to AF, images get fuzzy when saved as a pdf, make sure that image compression in ppt template is turned off
- [ ] Powerpoint reference library installed

####Other:

- [ ] Make code into classes (as per DER convo)
- [ ] Generalize super/subscript
- [ ] make this sheet read only
- [ ] All of the things where if you don’t have 2 rows or columns is doesn’t work
- [ ] The first column of the text_data doesn't do anything, so indicate that. well it does set the file name right?

### Not MVP

- [ ] Currently only PC-compatible
